This file project emulates a simplified version of a casino roulette.

This is an exercice found in the Python OpenClassroom book by Vincent le Goff

The roulette works that way:

	-The players enters how money have
	-A loop starts and stops when players run out of money or do not want to go on
	-Players place a bet on a tile
	-The randrange function generates the winning roulette spot
	-A function computes the profits

The profits work that way:
-Correct tile, 3 times the bet
-Correct tile color, half the bet
-No profit otherwise
